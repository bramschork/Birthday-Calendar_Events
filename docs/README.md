# Birthday Calendar Event Generator

This program will create a file you can import into your Google Calendar that contains your students birthdays!

Instructions:

**Please download your students birthdays first. They must be in the strict format of "Last, First|Form|Birthday(mm-dd-yy)". Please do not include "Preffered Name". The program relies on strict accordance to this input formatting. Ensure Excel does not auto-format your dates to a different format. An example of the input format can be found in "docs/example_data.csv" in the folder you will download below. Please no extra lines or formatting in the document.**

1) Click on "Windows Release" under the "Releases" tab on the GitHub page.
2) Click on the release ending in ".zip" to begin downloading the program.
3) Once the ZIP is downloaded onto your computer, right-click on the file to un-zip it. If you are on Windows, double-click the executable file titled "main_v1.0.py".
4) The program will prompt you to select a file. Navigate to your input data file CSV of the birthdays. You can double-click on the input data file to select it.

Almost immedietly after selecting the input data file, the program will end. The program will have outputted a file in the same folder as the executable a file called "OUTPUT_CalendarEvents.csv". This CSV file contains the events to import into your Google Calendar.

**I recommend creating a new calendar to import the birthdays. This way, if there is any issue with the program, you can simply delete the bad calendar, rather than having to sift through your main calendar.
